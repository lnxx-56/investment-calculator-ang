# Portfolio Diversification Calculator

## Overview

The Portfolio Diversification Calculator is an advanced investment tool that allows users to:

- Allocate investments across multiple asset classes
- Set unique expected returns and risk levels for each asset class
- Simulate portfolio rebalancing at specified intervals
- Compare diversified portfolio performance to standard investment strategy

## Features

### Asset Allocation

- Dynamic allocation of investments across multiple asset classes
- Interactive sliders to adjust allocation percentages
- Lock specific assets to maintain their allocation while adjusting others
- Add/remove asset classes as needed

### Risk Assessment

- Real-time portfolio risk calculation based on weighted asset risks
- Visual risk indicator showing overall portfolio risk level
- Ability to adjust risk levels for individual asset classes

### Rebalancing Simulator

- Simulate portfolio rebalancing at user-defined intervals
- View the effects of rebalancing on long-term portfolio performance
- Highlight rebalancing events in the results table

### Performance Comparison

- Side-by-side comparison with standard single-rate investment
- Calculate performance differences between diversified and non-diversified strategies
- Toggle comparison view on/off as needed

## Using the Calculator

1. **Basic Setup**:
   - Set your initial investment amount
   - Set your annual contribution amount
   - Set the investment duration in years
   - Set the rebalancing frequency (0 = no rebalancing)

2. **Asset Configuration**:
   - Adjust allocation percentages using sliders (must total 100%)
   - Set expected return rates for each asset class
   - Set risk levels for each asset class
   - Add or remove asset classes as needed

3. **Calculate and Analyze**:
   - Click "Calculate Portfolio Performance" to run the simulation
   - Review the year-by-year breakdown of your portfolio
   - Compare with standard investment performance if enabled
   - Note any rebalancing events that occurred

## Implementation Notes

The calculator uses sophisticated financial modeling to simulate:
- Compound interest effects on different asset classes
- Reallocation of funds during rebalancing events
- Risk-adjusted returns based on asset allocation
- Comparison to traditional single-rate investment strategies
